## Portfolio Projects
In this section I will list data analytics projects briefly describing the technology and tools used to solve cases.

### Analyzing top 50 paid athletes in the world
**Code:** [`Analyzing top 50 most paid athletes in the world`](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/milos.mrkajic/viz/Hihgestpaidathletes/Story1)

**Goal:** To determine the top paid athletes and what factors contribute to their success.

**Description:** The project focused on analyzing a dataset from Tableu's Monday challenge. I was curious how much off-the-field earnings are influencing the list. Which sports dominate the list. Which athletes top the list. Based on the fields: on-the-field earnings, off-the-field earnings, sports and names, my plan is to get insights from this dataset.
Using Tableau I will focus on analyzing the dataset with charts and present all my insights in the form of a Tableau story.

**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, data visualization.

**Technology:** Excel, Tableau

**Results:** All my insights I have presented in my Tableau story.

### Meat production in Germany

**Goal:** To analyze production of Beef, Pork and Poultry in Germany between 2000 and 2022.

**Code:** [`Meat production in Germany`](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/milos.mrkajic/viz/MeatproductioninGermany_17155291173500/Story1)

**Description:** The dataset contains a list of three types of meat production over the years in the 21th century. My goal is to see production rates of each type of meat over the years and comparing them to each other. I am also interested in the development of production trends in the last few years compared to the beginning of the century. This dataset is also from the Monday challenge from Tableau. My insights and answers I will present in the form of Tableau story.

**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, data visualization.

**Technology:** Excel, Tableau

**Results:** All my insights I have presented in my Tableau story.



### Sleep health and lifestyle
**Code:** [`Sleep health and lifestyle Data Cleaning`](https://github.com/Seki1996/example/blob/main/Sleep%20health%20and%20lifestyle%20Data%20Cleaning.sql)

**Description:** The dataset is "Sleep health and lifestyle". The main column in the dataset is "Sleep Disorder". Other columns are describing lifestyle habits like occupation, quality of sleep, stress level, heart rate, blood pressure. Tha main goal is to showcase data cleaning skills in MySQL. Before analyzing the data, the first step is always cleaning the dataset, so that the dataset could be properly analyzed. Steps like renaming fields, deleting duplicate rows, creating new useful fields and others. Most of my Data Cleaning is done in MySQL or Excel. 


**Skills:** DML(Data Manipulation Language), DQL (Data Query Language), DDL (Data Definition Language).

**Technology:** MySQL


### Company departments Extractions
**Code:** [`Company departments Extractions`](https://github.com/Seki1996/example/blob/main/Company%20departments%20Extractions.sql)

**Description:** The dataset contains different parts of company branches: accounts, employees, customers, departments, etc. The main goal of this script is to shwocase my SQL skills. From the basic CRUD operations to more advanced joins, views and aggregated functions. MySQL is great for working with data ranging from creating database, managing it and extracting needed information.

**Skills:** Joins, CTE's, Temp Tables, Aggregate Functions, Creating Views, Converting Data Types

**Technology:** MySQL



### Sales Report

**Goal:** To make a sales report for a company based on the sales dataset.

**Code:** [`Sales Report`](https://github.com/Seki1996/example/blob/main/Sales_report.xlsx)

**Description:** The goal is to present a Sales Report in  Excel. Analyzing the dataset, my goal is to answer all the relevant questions being asked: how the sales are doing over time, who the most important clients are , how the branches compare to each other and which payment methods the clients prefer?

**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, data visualization.

**Technology:** Excel



### Student Performance

**Goal:** To analyze if there are any factors which predict students performance.

**Code:** [`Student Performance`](https://github.com/Seki1996/example/blob/main/Students%20performance%20Analysis.xlsx)

**Description:** In the quest to determine the presence of and type of factors that contribute to students performance. Fields in this dataset are gender, race, parent's education, test preparation courses. Data cleaning is also done in Excel.

**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, data visualization.

**Technology:** Excel



### Sales Reporting Analysis

**Goal:** To analyze the 'Sales Report' dataset in purpose to determine how well the company is operating

**Code:** [`Sales Reporting`](https://github.com/Seki1996/example/blob/main/sales-report-analysis.ipynb)

**Description:** Analyzing the 'Sales Report' dataset I will use Pandas for data loading, preprocessing and analysis. Further, I will use Seaborn and Matplotlib for data visualization.

**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, data visualization.

**Technology:** Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib
